# Travel Vaccine Report Builder

## A tool for pharmacists that creates a personalized report containing travel vaccines  for a patient's trip to their indicated destination

**What this project will do:**
- Users will input patient information (name and age)
- Users will input the patient destination(s)
- The user will then add the recommended vaccines
-  A report will be made containing patient information, destinations and recommended vaccines

**Who will use this project:**
- This project is to be used by pharmacists (and other travel health experts)

**Why this project is of interest:**
- Previoulsy I worked as a travel medicine consultant conducting pre-travel appointments and providing patients with a report of what vaccines they need based on where they are going. I am hoping this tool will be able to create reports that patients can reference and expidites the process for the consultant in generating the report.

**User Stories**
- As a user I want to be able to generate a report of vaccine recommendations for a given person's destination(s)
- As a user I want to be able to add the generated reports in a reports library
- As a user I want to be able to see a list of reports made 
- As a user I want to be able to select reports and view them in detail
