## A tool that creates a personalized travel vaccine list for a user going to their indicated destination

**What this project will do:**

- The tool will provide country specific recommendations for appropriate travel vaccines
- List the required vaccine dosage and schedule given a *persons age*, *risk factors*, and *previous vaccination history*

**Who will use this project:**
- This project is primarily aimed at all travellers. This will provide up to date information about travel vaccinations to ensure every user is protecting their health whilst travelling.

**Why this project is of interest:**

Previoulsy I worked as a travel medicine consultant, providing people with travel vaccine reccomendations based on their destination. It has been a goal to try an automate some of the process via an application that could take in a travelers details and provide an individual specific recommendation for that upcoming trip. While I plan to start with some constraints in place, I hope to eventually expand the project to be used in all instances of travel.

**User Stories**
- As a user I want to be able to select my country of destination
- As a user I want to be able to input relevant information to get a personalized recommendation
- As a user I want to be able to view the list of vaccines that are recommended
- As a user I want to be able to select the vaccines I have received and remove them from the list
